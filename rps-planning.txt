When the page loads, the user is presented with four buttons:

1. new game, starts a new game and calls the game() function.
    -game() displays the directions, and then calls the playRound() function. 
    -playRound() calls the playerSelection() function and the computerPlay() function.
    -playerSelection() should listen to what the user 'clicks' and store that selection in a     
     variable to be returned.
    -computerPlay() randomly chooses between rock, paper, or scissors and returns the choice in a 
     variable.
    -game() then runs the code to determine the score by adding a point to either the computer or 
     the player and then display the running total score. If the score gets to five points total, the game should end and the final score should be posted.
2. rock, paper, scissors buttons allows the user to select the respective button as their weapon 
     choice.
    -when the button is pressed, the player's choice is equal to whichever button was pressed and 
     the playRound() function is called.

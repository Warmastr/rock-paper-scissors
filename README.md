# rock-paper-scissors GUI
This is the: Revisiting the Rock Paper Scissors where I add a graphical user interface (GUI) to the console version of the RPS program. In addition to adding some user interactivity via a GUI, this program will introduce me to refactoring/modifying existing code which is a new concept.

Reflection:

This project took several days and was more difficult than I imagined. I wound up needing help a few times to get my head wrapped around callback functions and variable scope. I now have a deeper understanding of using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, in addition to the struggle points I mentioned. 

Conclusion:

Despite the points of contention that took some serious looking into, this project was fun and it feels good to have completed it. In all, I probably spend around 15 hours or so programming it spread over 10 days. I would like to have finished it sooner, but being a full-time student is demanding of my time and so I had to split my time with class requirements for the university! The Etch A Sketch project is next and I'm really looking forward to continuing it and The Odin Project!

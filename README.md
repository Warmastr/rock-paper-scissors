# rock-paper-scissors
This is my first Javascript program from scratch. This program is intended to introduce problem-solving techniques whilst utilizing the programming syntax I've learned to date. 

This program is a simple replica of the famouse Rock Paper Scissors game played as children, typically to decide between two or more people. This version is a player vs. the computer version where there is a random chance to win. May the best player win!
